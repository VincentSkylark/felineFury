# Feline Fury

A top-down dodging game where a black cat uses a short-range melee (Z, long cooldown) and bounces cucumbers back at enemies — for js13k 2025.

## Story

Embark on a black cat's adventure through the house, battling pesky cucumbers, a relentless robot vacuum, and slippery flippers — all in pursuit of his favorite snack: cookie.

## Gameplay

Use the arrow keys to move and press Z to attack. If you hit a cucumber, it will bounce back and can strike enemies.
